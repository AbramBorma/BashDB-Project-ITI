Note that all text commands must be first on line and end with ';'

clear     (\c) Clear the current input statement.
Clear the current input. Use this if you change your mind about executing the statement that you are entering.

go        (\g) Send command to mysql server.
Send the current statement to the server to be executed.

print     (\p) Print current command.
Print the current input statement without executing it.

use       (\u) Use another database. Takes database name as argument.
Use db_name as the default database.

quit      (\q) Quit mysql.

\quit should always bypass all and quit 


Database, table, and column names should not contains space characters or reserved Words.
Table and Database	Any character that is allowed in a filename, except ‘/’, ‘\’, or ‘.’
ASCII: [0-9,a-z,A-Z_] (basic Latin letters, digits 0-9, underscore)


The table name can be specified as db_name.tbl_name to create the table in a specific database. This works regardless of whether there is a default database, 
CREATE TABLE t1
CREATE TABLE lookup (id INT, name STRING)


DROP [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF EXISTS]


DELETE tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*]] ...
    FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]

DELETE FROM table_name; Deletes the whole table data where Drop will remove the table with the structure


INSERT INTO tbl_name () VALUES();

INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1,col2) VALUES(col2*2,15);

INSERT INTO tbl_name (a,b,c)
    VALUES(1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9);


-Use of an unqualified * with other items in the select list may produce a parse error. For example:
SELECT id, * FROM t1


-A select_expr can be given an alias using AS alias_name. The alias is used as the expression's -column name and can be used in GROUP BY, ORDER BY, or HAVING clauses. For example:

SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) AS full_name
  FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;


-The AS keyword is optional when aliasing a select_expr with an identifier. The preceding example -could have been written like this:

SELECT CONCAT(last_name,', ',first_name) full_name
  FROM mytable ORDER BY full_name;


-However, because the AS is optional, a subtle problem can occur if you forget the comma between two -select_expr expressions: MySQL interprets the second as an alias name. For example, in the following -statement, columnb is treated as an alias name:

SELECT columna columnb FROM mytable;
-For this reason, it is good practice to be in the habit of using AS explicitly when specifying -column aliases.

-Columns selected for output can be referred to in ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses using column names, -column aliases, or column positions. Column positions are integers and begin with 1:

SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
  ORDER BY region, seed;

SELECT college, region AS r, seed AS s FROM tournament
  ORDER BY r, s;

SELECT college, region, seed FROM tournament
  ORDER BY 2, 3;

-selecting the same table twice is not premitted as there is no group by implemented

## in case of not implementing "ORDER BY" & "WHERE" -> "From" should be in poistion -2
